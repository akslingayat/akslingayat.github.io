# Welcome to my Webpage!

This webpage holds several purposes:
1. To practice my coding skills while learning about how to implement new technologies
2. Demonstrate my willingness to showcase my abilities (as amateur as they are)
3. Land a product management role
4. Have fun with what new tech has to offer

**Note: This will always be a work in progress project so (plz don't judge on the lack of imagination...for now)*
